After a stellar domestic season where he topped the run-scoring charts in both the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and the Vijay Hazare Trophy, Padikkal didn`t disappoint when he finally got his chance in the IPL. He smashed 473 runs and even outscored the duo of Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers in his very first season. He hasn`t slowed down with Karnataka reaping the rewards of the southpaw`s exploits. His attacking instinct and ability to score all across the ground make him a special talent and it shouldn`t be long before he earns an Indian call-up. Padikkal also scored his maiden IPL hundred in 2021 and is one of the youngest to achieve the milestone in the competition.",
